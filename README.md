whatsapp-bulk-sender
A client-side web tool for opening WhatsApp chat links in bulk (up to 180 numbers).
Features

Multiple Link Modes — Auto-detect, web.whatsapp.com, api.whatsapp.com, or wa.me
CSV Import — Extract phone numbers automatically from uploaded files
Pause/Resume — Save progress to localStorage and continue later
Auto-Clipboard — Copies message before each link as fallback for long texts
Single-Tab Mode — Reuse one browser tab instead of opening many
Shuffle Option — Randomize the order of numbers
RTL Interface — Full Arabic UI support

How It Works

Paste phone numbers (comma, space, or newline separated) or upload a CSV
Write your message
Set delay between links (minimum 5 seconds)
Click Start — the tool opens WhatsApp chat links sequentially
Manually press Send in each chat window

Usage Tips

Disable your browser's popup blocker
Log into web.whatsapp.com beforehand
Use Pause to stop and Resume to continue from where you left off

Important Notes

This tool only opens chat links — sending messages is done manually
No data is stored on any server; everything runs in your browser
Phone numbers should include country code (e.g., 966501234567)
